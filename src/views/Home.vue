      Cardiomyopathy (kahr-dee-o-my-OP-uh-thee) is a disease of the heart muscle
      that makes it harder for your heart to pump blood to the rest of your
      body. Cardiomyopathy can lead to heart failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main types of cardiomyopathy include dilated, hypertrophic and
      restrictive cardiomyopathy. Treatment — which might include medications,
      surgically implanted devices or, in severe cases, a heart transplant —
      depends on which type of cardiomyopathy you have and how serious it is.
